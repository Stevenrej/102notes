My Reading Notes for class 1

My name is Steven Rejdukowski and I am ready to start my coding journey! It has been a goal of mine to learn coding for a while and now I am getting into it.



To me a growth mindset is being open to whatever comes your way. If something is not easy or familiar that usually means there is an oppurtunity for growth in that situation.

3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- Stay open minded
- trust yourself, you are always greater than you know
- be willing to receive help from others, you cannot do everything on your own
