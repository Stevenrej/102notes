*NOTES*

**CHOOSING TEXT EDITORS**

Choosing a text editor is very much a personal choice

Text editors are software that has been downloaded or used through a web browser that lets you write and manage text. 

Looks for code completion, syntax highlight, themes, and a good library of extensions.

Extra Bonus for software that works well with HTML and CSS

Always code in plain text, you do not want bold or colored text for it may cause issues in the future

Manage documents well when using your text editors so as to not cause extra clutter on your computer

3-Party software has some extra benefits that the usual text editors do not have

Text editors just wrangle your text while IDEs have multiple software in one package
