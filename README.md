*To me a growth mindset is being open to whatever comes your way. If something is not easy or familiar that usually means there is an oppurtunity for growth in that situation.*

### **3 Reminders to kep myself in the growth mindset:**
- Stay open minded
- trust yourself, you are always greater than you know
- be willing to receive help from others, *you* cannot do <sub>everything</sub> on your own
