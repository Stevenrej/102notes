My Reading Notes

*To me a growth mindset is being open to whatever comes your way. If something is not easy or familiar that usually means there is an oppurtunity for growth in that situation.*

### **3 Reminders to kep myself in the growth mindset:**
-Stay open minded
-trust yourself, you arealways greater than you know
-be willing to recive help from others you cannot do everything on your own
