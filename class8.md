# Notes for Class 8

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
Copy to Clipboard
When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the conditionExpression expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.
If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
Control returns to Step 2.

while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement

If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.

Example
In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list (a <select> element that allows multiple selections).

HTML
<form name="selectForm">
  <label for="musicTypes">Choose some music types, then click the button below:</label>
  <select id="musicTypes" name="musicTypes" multiple>
    <option selected>R&B</option>
    <option>Jazz</option>
    <option>Blues</option>
    <option>New Age</option>
    <option>Classical</option>
    <option>Opera</option>
  </select>
  <button id="btn" type="button">How many are selected?</button>
</form>
JavaScript
Here, the for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0. It checks that i is less than the number of options in the <select> element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.

function howMany(selectObject) {
  let numberSelected = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) {
    if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {
      numberSelected++;
    }
  }
  return numberSelected;
}

const btn = document.getElementById('btn');

btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes;
  console.log(`You have selected ${howMany(musicTypes)} option(s).`);
});
while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement
Copy to Clipboard
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.

Example 1
The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
Copy to Clipboard
With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

Example 2
Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:

// Infinite loops are bad!
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}

Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed in the following table:

Name	Shorthand operator	Meaning
Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	x <<= f()	x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	x >>= f()	x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= f()	x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= f()	x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= f()	x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= f()	x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	x &&= f()	x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	x ||= f()	x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	x ?? (x = f())
Assigning to properties
If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression. For example:

const obj = {};

obj.x = 3;
console.log(obj.x); // Prints 3.
console.log(obj); // Prints { x: 3 }.

const key = "y";
obj[key] = 5;
console.log(obj[key]); // Prints 5.
console.log(obj); // Prints { x: 3, y: 5 }.
For more information about objects, read Working with Objects.

If an expression does not evaluate to an object, then assignments to properties of that expression do not assign:

const val = 0;
val.x = 3;

console.log(val.x); // Prints undefined.
console.log(val); // Prints 0.
In strict mode, the code above throws, because one cannot assign properties to primitives.

It is an error to assign values to unmodifiable properties or to properties of an expression without properties (null or undefined).

Destructuring
For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

// without destructuring
const one   = foo[0];
const two   = foo[1];
const three = foo[2];

// with destructuring
const [one, two, three] = foo;
Evaluation and nesting
In general, assignments are used within a variable declaration (i.e., with const, let, or var) or as standalone statements).

// Declares a variable x and initializes it to the result of f().
// The result of the x = f() assignment expression is discarded.
let x = f();

x = g(); // Reassigns the variable x to the result of g().
However, like other expressions, assignment expressions like x = f() evaluate into a result value. Although this result value is usually not used, it can then be used by another expression.

Chaining assignments or nesting assignments in other expressions can result in surprising behavior. For this reason, some JavaScript style guides discourage chaining or nesting assignments). Nevertheless, assignment chaining and nesting may occur sometimes, so it is important to be able to understand how they work.

By chaining or nesting an assignment expression, its result can itself be assigned to another variable. It can be logged, it can be put inside an array literal or function call, and so on.

let x;
const y = (x = f()); // Or equivalently: const y = x = f();
console.log(y); // Logs the return value of the assignment x = f().

console.log(x = f()); // Logs the return value directly.

// An assignment expression can be nested in any place
// where expressions are generally allowed,
// such as array literals' elements or as function calls' arguments.
console.log([ 0, x = f(), 0 ]);
console.log(f(0, x = f(), 0));
The evaluation result matches the expression to the right of the = sign in the "Meaning" column of the table above. That means that x = f() evaluates into whatever f()'s result is, x += f() evaluates into the resulting sum x + f(), x **= f() evaluates into the resulting power x ** y, and so on.

In the case of logical assignments, x &&= f(), x ||= f(), and x ??= f(), the return value is that of the logical operation without the assignment, so x && f(), x || f(), and x ?? f(), respectively.

When chaining these expressions without parentheses or other grouping operators like array literals, the assignment expressions are grouped right to left (they are right-associative), but they are evaluated left to right.

Note that, for all assignment operators other than = itself, the resulting values are always based on the operands' values before the operation.

For example, assume that the following functions f and g and the variables x and y have been declared:

function f () {
  console.log('F!');
  return 2;
}
function g () {
  console.log('G!');
  return 3;
}
let x, y;
Consider these three examples:

y = x = f()
y = [ f(), x = g() ]
x[f()] = g()
Evaluation example 1
y = x = f() is equivalent to y = (x = f()), because the assignment operator = is right-associative. However, it evaluates from left to right:

The assignment expression y = x = f() starts to evaluate.
The y on this assignment's left-hand side evaluates into a reference to the variable named y.
The assignment expression x = f() starts to evaluate.
The x on this assignment's left-hand side evaluates into a reference to the variable named x.
The function call f() prints "F!" to the console and then evaluates to the number 2.
That 2 result from f() is assigned to x.
The assignment expression x = f() has now finished evaluating; its result is the new value of x, which is 2.
That 2 result in turn is also assigned to y.
The assignment expression y = x = f() has now finished evaluating; its result is the new value of y â€“ which happens to be 2. x and y are assigned to 2, and the console has printed "F!".
Evaluation example 2
y = [ f(), x = g() ] also evaluates from left to right:

The assignment expression y = [ f(), x = g() ] starts to evaluate.
The y on this assignment's left-hand evaluates into a reference to the variable named y.
The inner array literal [ f(), x = g() ] starts to evaluate.
The function call f() prints "F!" to the console and then evaluates to the number 2.
The assignment expression x = g() starts to evaluate.
The x on this assignment's left-hand side evaluates into a reference to the variable named x.
The function call g() prints "G!" to the console and then evaluates to the number 3.
That 3 result from g() is assigned to x.
The assignment expression x = g() has now finished evaluating; its result is the new value of x, which is 3. That 3 result becomes the next element in the inner array literal (after the 2 from the f()).
The inner array literal [ f(), x = g() ] has now finished evaluating; its result is an array with two values: [ 2, 3 ].
That [ 2, 3 ] array is now assigned to y.
The assignment expression y = [ f(), x = g() ] has now finished evaluating; its result is the new value of y â€“ which happens to be [ 2, 3 ]. x is now assigned to 3, y is now assigned to [ 2, 3 ], and the console has printed "F!" then "G!".
Evaluation example 3
x[f()] = g() also evaluates from left to right. (This example assumes that x is already assigned to some object. For more information about objects, read Working with Objects.)

The assignment expression x[f()] = g() starts to evaluate.
The x[f()] property access on this assignment's left-hand starts to evaluate.
The x in this property access evaluates into a reference to the variable named x.
Then the function call f() prints "F!" to the console and then evaluates to the number 2.
The x[f()] property access on this assignment has now finished evaluating; its result is a variable property reference: x[2].
Then the function call g() prints "G!" to the console and then evaluates to the number 3.
That 3 is now assigned to x[2]. (This step will succeed only if x is assigned to an object.)
The assignment expression x[f()] = g() has now finished evaluating; its result is the new value of x[2] â€“ which happens to be 3. x[2] is now assigned to 3, and the console has printed "F!" then "G!".
Avoid assignment chains
Chaining assignments or nesting assignments in other expressions can result in surprising behavior. For this reason, chaining assignments in the same statement is discouraged).

In particular, putting a variable chain in a const, let, or var statement often does not work. Only the outermost/leftmost variable would get declared; other variables within the assignment chain are not declared by the const/let/var statement. For example:

const z = y = x = f();
This statement seemingly declares the variables x, y, and z. However, it only actually declares the variable z. y and x are either invalid references to nonexistent variables (in strict mode) or, worse, would implicitly create global variables for x and y in sloppy mode.

Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality. The following table describes the comparison operators in terms of this sample code:

const var1 = 3;
const var2 = 4;
Comparison operators
Operator	Description	Examples returning true
Equal (==)	Returns true if the operands are equal.	3 == var1
"3" == var1

3 == '3'
Not equal (!=)	Returns true if the operands are not equal.	var1 != 4
var2 != "3"
Strict equal (===)	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.	3 === var1
Strict not equal (!==)	Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.	var1 !== "3"
3 !== '3'
Greater than (>)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	var2 > var1
"12" > 2
Greater than or equal (>=)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.	var2 >= var1
var1 >= 3
Less than (<)	Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	var1 < var2
"2" < 12
Less than or equal (<=)	Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.	var1 <= var2
var2 <= 5
Note: => is not a comparison operator but rather is the notation for Arrow functions.
